This is an iOS implementation of the "„Éû„Éû„ÅØ„Å≤„Å†„Çä„Åã„ÇâÊï∞„Åà„Å¶„Å™„Çì„Å∞„Çì„ÇÅÔºü" counting game, which challenges players to find the "mama" character at a specified position counting from the left.

## Features

## How to Play

1. The game will show a line of characters (mostly emoji) with one "mama" (üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) character.
2. The prompt at the top asks which position the "mama" is, counting from the left.
3. Tap the correct number at the bottom of the screen.

5. If incorrect, you'll hear a different sound and can try again.
6. The game gets progressively harder with more characters appearing.
